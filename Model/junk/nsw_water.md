	## [Namoi Unregulated and Alluvial][namoi_unreg]

(1)  At the commencement of this Plan, the water requirements of persons entitled to domestic and stock rights in these water sources are estimated to total 1,618.8 megalitres per year (hereafter ML/year), distributed as follows:
(l)  55.4 ML/year in the Maules Creek Water Source,

It is estimated that at the time of commencement of this Plan the share components of domestic and stock access licences authorised to take water from these water sources total 627 ML/year, distributed as follows:
(l)  7 ML/year in the Maules Creek Water Source,

It is estimated that at the time of commencement of this Plan the share components of unregulated river access licences authorised to take water from these water sources total 109,040.5 unit shares, distributed as follows:
(l)  1,406 unit shares in the Maules Creek Water Source,

	### Maules Creek Rules
	Cease to pump when flow drops below 1ML/day at Maules Creek at Avoca East Gauge (419051)

    ## [Upper and Lower Namoi Groundwater Sources] [namoi_gw]
    
    (k)  Upper Namoi Zone 11, Maules Creek Groundwater Source (hereafter Zone 11)

   (1)  For the purposes of section 5 (3) of the Act, the overall basis for water sharing in this Plan is the estimated average annual recharge to each groundwater source as follows:
(k)  2,200 ML/yr, plus the requirements for basic landholder rights at the commencement of this plan in Zone 11,

(1)  At the commencement of this Plan the water requirements of holders of domestic and stock rights in these groundwater sources are estimated to be as follows:
(k)  210 ML/yr in Zone 11,

(3)  For those Water Act 1912 entitlements that are to become aquifer access licences in Zone 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, and the Lower Namoi at the commencement of this Plan, the share component will be established in accordance with the following formula:

(9)  It is estimated that at the time of commencement of this Plan, the share components of aquifer access licences authorised to extract water from these groundwater sources will total 191,313 ML/yr, distributed as follows:
(k)  2,200 ML/yr in Zone 11,

 (2) The share component of a supplementary water access licence converted under subclause (1) will be established for those licences where HOE > SCAAL in accordance with the following formula:

 (7)  It is estimated that at the time of commencement of this Plan the sum of supplementary water access licences established under subclauses (1) for these groundwater sources will total 59,079 ML and be distributed as follows:
 (h)  15 ML/yr in Zone 11,

 (2)  The extraction limit for each groundwater source each year of this Plan is the recharge established in clause 16, minus the proportion of recharge reserved as planned environmental water in clause 18, plus total water made available to supplementary water access licences under clause 29, and are initially as follows:
 (k)  2,200 ML/yr plus total water made available to supplementary water access licences under clause 29 plus basic rights in Zone 11,

(2)  If there is any change to the extraction limits arising from subclause (1) then:
 (k)  the extraction limit for Zone 11 will not be greater than 2,750 ML/yr, plus total water made available to supplementary water access licences under clause 29, plus the total requirements for basic landholder rights at the commencement of this plan and will not be less than 1,650 ML/yr, plus total water made available to supplementary water access licences under clause 29 plus the total requirements for basic landholder rights at the commencement of this plan,
